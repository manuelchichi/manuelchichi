### Some of my work on Github

- [A Redmine Prioritization plugin](https://github.com/manuelchichi/dss-pnrp-redmine-plugin) that adds to Redmine a way to prioritize issues in projects.
- [A Redmine Prioritization API](https://github.com/manuelchichi/dss-pnrp-api) for solving prioritization processes. Needed for previous repository.
