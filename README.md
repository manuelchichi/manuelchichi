### Some of my work on Github
- [A dog recognitizion tool](https://github.com/manuelchichi/dog-race-recognition) where using pretrained neural networks and databases indexes we were able to determine the race of a dog.
- [A Redmine Prioritization plugin](https://github.com/manuelchichi/dss-pnrp-redmine-plugin) a Redmine plugin that added the possibility of making prioritization processes between issues in projects.
- [A Redmine Prioritization API](https://github.com/manuelchichi/dss-pnrp-api) a Python API for solving prioritization processes. Needed for previous repository.
